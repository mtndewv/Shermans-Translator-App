# Shermans-Translator-App

This repository contains a minimal starting point for generating circular patterns based on text input. Each letter in the input is mapped to a pattern type and modifier. This is only a textual representation; you can extend it later to draw actual graphics.

> **Note**
> The current implementation is intentionally simple and acts only as a placeholder. A more complete UI and additional features are planned for future updates.

## Usage

Run `main.py` and enter some text when prompted. The program will output a description of the circular pattern for each letter.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Example Output
```
Enter text: abc
Generated Patterns:
Letter 'a': pattern=solid, modifier=small
Letter 'b': pattern=solid, modifier=medium
Letter 'c': pattern=solid, modifier=large
```
